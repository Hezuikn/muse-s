## to elaborate a bit on why i want it

- realtime sleep staging
- tracking sleep onset
- gauging of sleep quality
- tracking hrv

it also tracks head movement

you can read the raw data, that makes it useful to me https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Respiire/MuseJS/refs/heads/main/Muse.js

hrv is like a relaxation indicator but also used in sleep staging on smart watches, stands for heart rate variability

knowing sleep onset helps me with https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2013/07/how-to-fall-asleep-in-less-than-30-seconds/
and rem-shifting aswell as iWILD

iWILD stands for indirect wake initiated lucid dream, you wake up and perform methods to dissociate from your body entering a lucid dream that way, see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352258607_An_effective_lucid_dreaming_method_by_inducing_hypnopompic_hallucinations

its commonly and unknowingly used by people who believe in "astral projection"

or for example to measure what difference reverse blinking makes for me https://www.dreamviews.com/attaining-lucidity/116171-double-reverse-blinking.html

i also want to try reproduce this (don't even ask me how i found it i don't know either)
